The main behaviors that we tested with our e2e tests include:
<br>
- Testing that the todos page can be navigated to
- Testing that the owner filter works
- Testing that the body filter works
- Testing that the filters work when overlapped
<br>
We tested the filters to make sure that the user can search 
the database effectively, and we checked that the filters 
can overlap properly.
